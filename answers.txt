What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Both git merge and get rebase are 2 types of merging. 

Git rebase lets users integrate changes from one branch to another and the logs are modified
once the action is complete. For example if there is a project with 3 commits
on the master branch named 1,2,3 and the feature branch commits as commit A and B - then if we perform
git rebase then the commits A and B will be rebased on the master branch as commit 4 and 5 and there will 
be no logs of the feature branches. Thus it shows the complete history of merging of commits.

Git merge lets you merge Git branches while the logs of commits on branches remain intact. For example if there is a project with 3 commits
on the master branch named 1,2,3 and the feature branch commits as commit A and B - then if we perform
git merge then commits A and B will be merged as commit 4 on the master branch. Thus you cannot track 
when and how the commits were merged on the target branch.

What is a remote repository?

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
